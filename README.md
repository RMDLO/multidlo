# MultiDLO: Simultaneous Shape Tracking of Multiple Deformable Linear Objects with Global-Local Topology Preservation

This repository contains the code for MultiDLO, an algorithm for tracking multiple DLOs from RGB-D streams. This software is an implementation of our paper, *MultiDLO: Simultaneous Shape Tracking of Multiple Deformable Linear Objects with Global-Local Topology Preservation*, by Jingyi Xiang and Holly Dinkel. All code is implemented in Python, and the paper preprint is shared [**here**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.13245.pdf).
